# School_District_Analysis
Analysis of standardized tests

## Project Overview 
Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results: 
For all analysis, the amount of change was minimal. Only after extending the decimal point, was one able to find differences.

* How is the district summary affected?

    * District Summary Revised (9th Grade Thomas High sudents dropped):
    ![District Summary Revised](https://github.com/krockway/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/DistrictSummary_Revised.png)
    * The district level average scores for math & reading, percent passing for math & reading and overall passing percentage decreased slightly, as seen in the comparison above. 

* How is the school summary affected?
    * School Summary Original:

    * School Summary Revised (9th Grade Thomas High sudents dropped):
    ![School Summary Revised](https://github.com/krockway/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/SchoolSummary_Revised.png)
    * The Thomas High School average scores for math, percent passing for math & reading and overall passing percentage decreased slightly, as seen in the comparison above. 
    * However the average reading score increased slightly when the 9th grader scores were dropped.
    * All other statistics remained the same

* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
    * Top Schools Original:

    * In the original analysis, Thomas High School was the 2nd best performing school with 90.94% of overall students passing both math and reading. However, once the 9th grade scores were removed they maintained the 2nd place status, but the overall passing percentage decreased to 90.63%.

* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
    * Math and reading scores by grade
        * Top Schools Original:

    ![Top Schools Revised](https://github.com/krockway/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/TopSchool_Revised.png)
        * Because the 9th grade scores were dropped, there was a negative impact on that grade level. No other grade levels saw a change in math or reading scores.
    * Scores by school spending
        * Spending Per Student Original:

## Summary: 
Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
