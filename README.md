# School_District_Analysis
Analysis of standardized tests

## Project Overview 
Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results: 
For all analysis, the amount of change was minimal. Only after extending the decimal point, was one able to find differences.

* How is the district summary affected?

    * District Summary Revised (9th Grade Thomas High scores dropped):
    ![District Summary Revised](https://github.com/krockway/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/DistrictSummary_Revised.png)
    * The district level average scores for math & reading, percent passing for math & reading and overall passing percentage decreased slightly, as seen in the comparison above. 

* How is the school summary affected?
    * School Summary Original:

    * School Summary Revised (9th Grade Thomas High scores dropped):
    ![School Summary Revised](https://github.com/krockway/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/SchoolSummary_Revised.png)
    * The Thomas High School average scores for math, percent passing for math & reading and overall passing percentage decreased slightly, as seen in the comparison above. 
    * However the average reading score increased slightly when the 9th grader scores were dropped.
    * All other statistics remained the same

* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
    * Top Schools Original:

    * Top Schools Revised (9th Grade Thomas High scores dropped):
    ![Top Schools Revised](https://github.com/krockway/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/TopSchool_Revised.png)
    * In the original analysis, Thomas High School was the 2nd best performing school with 90.94% of overall students passing both math and reading. However, once the 9th grade scores were removed they maintained the 2nd place status, but the overall passing percentage decreased to 90.63%.

* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
    * Math and reading scores by grade
        * Grade Level Original:
            ![Grade Level Original](https://github.com/krockway/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/ByGrade.png)
        * Grade Level Revised (9th Grade Thomas High scores dropped):
            ![Grade Level Revised](https://github.com/krockway/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/ByGrade_Revised.png)
        * Because the 9th grade scores were dropped, there was a negative impact on that grade level. No other grade levels saw a change in math or reading scores.
    
    * Scores by school spending
        * Spending Per Student Original:
    ![Spending Per Student Original](https://github.com/krockway/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/Spending.png)
        * Spending Per Student (9th Grade Thomas High scores dropped):
    ![Spending Per Student Revised](https://github.com/krockway/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/Spending_Revised.png)
        * Thomas High School spends $638 per student.

    * Scores by school size
        * School Size Original:
    ![School Size Original](https://github.com/krockway/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/Size.png)
        * School Size Revised (9th Grade Thomas High scores dropped):
    ![School Size Revised](https://github.com/krockway/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/Size_Revised.png)
        * Thomas High School has 1,635 students and is considered a medium sized school. The medium sized school statistics were negatively impacted when the 9th grade scores from Thomas High were dropped. As seen in the images above, the average math score, percentage passing math & reading and overall passing percentage decreased. The average reading scores increased slightly. No other group saw changes.
    
    * Scores by school type
        * School Types Original:
    ![School Types Original](https://github.com/krockway/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/Type.png)
        * School Types (9th Grade Thomas High scores dropped): ![School Types Revised](https://github.com/krockway/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/Type_Revised.png)
        * For the most part, the charter schools statistics were negatively impacted when the 9th grade scores from Thomas High were dropped. As seen in the images above, the average math score, percentage passing math and overall passing percentage decreased. The average reading scores and percentage passing reading both increased slightly. District schools saw no change.

## Summary: 
Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
